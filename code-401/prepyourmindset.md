### Assessing my emotional intelligence

> My assessment showed that my highest components were self-awareness and social-awareness while my lowest components were relationship management and self-management. My self-awareness component scored an overall 24, which comes at no surprise considering my lifetime of dealing with social anxiety. This seems to highlight that I can be overly self and socially aware. The other end of the sword are the long term effects that anxiety has on my mental health and stress levels, with my lowest score being 14 on my relationship management component. This assessment showed that my stress coping skills and my social anxieties need to be better balanced, which I have been improving on this year!

### Assessing my bias

> I have taken small steps towards improvement since taking the assessment a few months ago and learning that my weaknesses involved not taking action and avoiding new situations. Taking the 401 course in person was a big milestone for me because it is a huge change in environment from the life I normally live. Additionally, being a mom to two kids greatly limits my time and makes it difficult to be involved with my community as i had wanted.
