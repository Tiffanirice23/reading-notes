## Node Ecosystem

#### How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

> "Think of a 'Node' like a train station. In a railway system, trains need to stop at different stations to pick up and drop off passengers. Each station is a 'Node.' It's a point where trains come together, and people or cargo can get on or off. So, a 'Node' is like a stop in a train network where connections are made.

#### What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

> it means that it allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server side of applications, providing the necessary runtime environment and tools for building efficient server applications using JavaScript.

#### What is Node used for?

> Node.js is a versatile runtime environment used for a wide range of use cases, such as web servers, Real-time Applications, and API Developement. It possessed an extensive package ecosystem, facilitated by npm (Node Package Manager), and offers a vast collection of open-source libraries and modules that streamline development in these various use cases.
