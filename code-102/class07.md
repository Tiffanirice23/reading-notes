# Class 7: Programming with JavaScript

### What is control flow?
> The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

### What is a JavaScript function?
> A JavaScript function is defined with the `function` keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses `()`, and can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

### What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?
> 1. When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
> 2. When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
> 3. Automatically (self invoked)

### What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?
> Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
