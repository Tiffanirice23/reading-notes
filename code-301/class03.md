## Passing Functions as Props

### [React Docs - lists and keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

#### What does .map() return?

> The .map() method is a function that operates on an array and returns a new array with the same number of items. It applies a callback function to each element of the original array and uses the return value of the callback function to create the corresponding element of the new array. 

#### If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

> Use the .map() method along with JSX to create a new array of React elements.

#### Each list item needs a unique ____.

> Each list item in React needs a unique "key" prop.

#### What is the purpose of a key?

> The purpose of a "key" prop in React is to help React efficiently update the user interface when the data changes. When a list of items is rendered in React, React uses the "key" prop to keep track of which items have been added, removed, or modified.

### [The Spread Operator](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

#### What is the spread operator?

> The spread operator is a syntax that allows an iterable such as an array or an object expression to be expanded or "spread" into multiple elements. It is used with three consecutive dots ....

#### List 4 things that the spread operator can do

> Copying an array, concatenating or combining arrays, using Math functions, using an array as arguments

#### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

> ` const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];`
`const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];`
`const combined = [...arr1, ...arr2];`

#### Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

> `const oldArr = [1, 2, 3];`
`const newItem = 4;`
`const newArr = [...oldArr, newItem];`

#### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

> `const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };`
`const address = { street: '123 Main St', city: 'Anytown', state: 'CA' };`
`const contactInfo = { ...person, ...address };`

### [How to Pass Functions Between Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c05OL7XbwXU)

#### In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

> First he created the functions wherever the state is that we're going to change

#### In your own words, what does the increment function do?

> When the increment function is called, it adds a determined value to the current value of the variable, thereby incrementing the variable

#### How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

> Use the props method by following the below:

1. Define the method you want to pass down from the parent component.

2. Pass the method as a prop to the child component.

3. In the child component, access the method through props and use it as needed.


#### How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

> A child component can invoke the method by calling it as a function. The method is typically passed down to the child component as a prop, and the child component can access it through this.props.
