##  REST

### [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

#### Who is Roy Fielding?

> Some guy that helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does

#### Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

> When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements.

#### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

> It's all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

#### What does a GET do?

> A method THAT requests data from a specified resource. It is used to retrieve information from the server. The request can include query parameters, which are added to the end of the URL.

#### What does a POST do?

> A method that submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effect on the server. It is used to send data to the server, which could be used for creating, updating or deleting resources.

#### What does PUT do?

> A method that replaces the entire resource at the specified URL with the data provided in the request body. It is used to update the entire resource, and can be used for both creating and updating resources.

#### What does PATCH do?
