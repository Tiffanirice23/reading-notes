##  Putting it all together

### [React Docs - Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

#### What is the `single responsibility principle` and how does it apply to components?

> The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a design principle in software engineering that states that every module, class, or function should have a single responsibility or reason to change. In other words, a component should only have one reason to change, and that is to fulfill its responsibility.

#### What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

> Building a static version of an application refers to generating a version of the application where the content is fixed or static, meaning that the data does not change dynamically in response to user input or other events.

#### Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

> Client-side Javascript, API integrations, forms and user input

#### What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

> Does it change over time? Is it affected by outside influences? Does it need to be remembered?

#### How can you identify where state needs to live?

> Identify the scope of the state, think about the data flow, consider the application architecture, prioritize simplicity and maintainability, and test different approaches

### [Higher-Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)

#### What is a “higher-order function”?

> a higher-order function is a function that takes another function as an argument, or returns a function as its result. It is a function that operates on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them as values.

#### Explore the `greaterThan` function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

#### Explain how either `map` or `reduce` operates, with regards to higher-order functions

> map is a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument and applies it to each element of an array, returning a new array of transformed values.

> Reduce is a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument and applies it to each element of an array, reducing the array to a single value.
