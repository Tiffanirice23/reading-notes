### [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4)

#### What is a ‘call’?

> a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

#### How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

> The number of calls that can happen simultaneously in a program depends on the programming language, the runtime environment, and the available system resources

#### What does LIFO mean?

> Last In, First Out.

#### What causes a Stack Overflow?

> Stack Overflow occurs when the call stack, a data structure used by programs to manage function calls, exceeds its maximum size.

### [JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)

#### What is a ‘reference error’?

> A type of error that occurs in JavaScript when you try to access a variable or function that has not been declared or is out of scope.

#### What is a ‘syntax error’?

> A "syntax error"  means that the code is not written in a valid and grammatically correct way according to the language's syntax rules.

#### What is a ‘range error’?

> A "RangeError" occurs when a numeric value is outside the valid range or when an invalid length or index is used. It typically indicates that a value exceeds the allowable bounds or falls outside the accepted range of values.

#### What is a ‘type error’?

> A "TypeError" occurs  when an operation or function is performed on an inappropriate or incompatible data type. It typically indicates that the program attempted to use a value or variable in a way that is not supported or allowed by its data type.

#### What is a breakpoint?

> A "breakpoint" is a debugging feature and a point in the source code where the execution of a program can be paused. When a breakpoint is set, it allows developers to inspect the state of the program at that specific location, examine variables, and step through the code line by line for debugging purposes

#### What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

> A "debugger" is a tool or software feature used by developers to identify and fix bugs or issues in their code.
