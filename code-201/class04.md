## HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

### Learn HTML

#### To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
> `<a>` is used to create a basic link.

####  The `href` attribute contains what information?
> The href attribute in an HTML anchor tag `<a>` contains the URL of the web page or resource that the link should point to.

#### What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
> There are several ways to ensure that links on a web page are accessible to all readers, including: proper link formatting, providing alternative text for images used as links, using semantic markup language (such as `<nav>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` tags), and testing the page with accessibility tools.

### CSS Layout

#### What is meant by “normal flow”?
> "Normal flow" refers to the default layout behavior of HTML elements on a web page without any positioning or floating applied to them. When an HTML element is rendered, it is placed in its natural position on the web page, based on the order of the HTML source code and the default positioning of the element itself.

#### What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline elements`?
> 1. *Line breaks*: Block-level elements create a line break before and after them, so they start on a new line and take up the full width available to them. Inline elements do not create line breaks, and they flow alongside other inline elements within their containing block.

> 2. *Box model properties*: Block-level elements can have all of the box model properties applied to them, including margin, padding, and border. Inline elements can only have left and right margin and padding applied to them, and their border is limited to a small line around the text.

> 3. *Nesting*: Block-level elements can contain both block-level and inline elements, while inline elements can only contain other inline elements or text.

> 4. *Content type*: Block-level elements are typically used for structural elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists, while inline elements are typically used for text-level elements, such as links, emphasized text, and spans of text

#### ___ positioning is the default for every html element.
> Static positioning is the default that every element gets. It just means "put the element into its normal position in the document flow — nothing special to see here."

#### Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
> Using absolute positioning on an element in CSS can have several advantages, such as precise placement, layering, animation, and responsive design.

#### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
> The key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning is how they are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor element.

### Learn JS
#### Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
- A function declaration is a way to define a function in a programming language. It typically includes the function name, the input parameters (if any), and the code that should be executed when the function is called.

- A function invocation is when the function is actually called or executed. 

> the main difference between a function declaration and a function invocation is that a declaration is a way to define a function, while an invocation is when the function is actually called or executed. 

#### What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

- A parameter is a variable that is declared in the function or method definition. It represents a value that is expected to be passed into the function when it is called.

- An argument is a value that is passed into the function when it is called.

 > A parameter is a variable declared in the function or method definition, while an argument is a value passed into the function or method when it is called.

### Miscellaneous

#### Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.

> Two benefits to pair programming that stand out to me are job interview readiness and work environment readiness! As much as I enjoy coding in solitary, it is not likely what my future work environment would be. My technical skills in coding may be rapidly improving, but my ability to communicate or understand programming jargon needs improvement to prepare me for a new career.

## Things I want to know more about

1. I would like more terms and definition comparison! Knowing more jargon beforehand would have lessened my confusion whenever getting help from teachers or TAs.
