## Basics of HTML, CSS, JS

### Introduction to HTML
#### Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

> 1. Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)

> 2. Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page

> 3. Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes

> 4. Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated

> 5. Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

#### How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

> There are 6 levels of headings, with h1 being the highest section level and h6 is the lowest.

#### What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?

- `sup`: The <sup>, or superscripts, are usually rendered with a *raised* baseline using smaller text.
> Example: Displaying exponents (x <sup>4</sup>), or representing ordinal numbers (4<sup>th</sup>)

- `sub`: the <sub>, or subscripts, are typically rendered with a *lowered* baseline using smaller text.
> Example: marking up footnote numbers or denoting the number of atoms of a given element within a chemical formula (H <sub>2</sub>0).

#### When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

> the `title` attribute, along with a full description and nothing else can provide an expansion for the abbreviation or acronym when a full expansion is not present.

### Learn CSS

#### What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

> CSS can be applied to an HTML document through 3 methods:
1. an external stylesheet (`<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />`)
2. with an internal stylesheet (`<style> h1 {color:blue;}</style>`)
3. or with inline syles. <p style="color:blue;">#1 CSS example</p>

#### Why should we avoid using inline styles?

Because one change might require multuple edits within a single web page, CSS mixes presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult. to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.
