#### What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

A PNG should be used. A PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format supports lossless compression, which means the image quality is not degraded even after multiple saves or edits.

#### Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

- The "background" color is like the color of the wall behind the element. It's the color that fills up the space behind the text or image.  Example: the background color of a regular piece of paper is white.

- The "foreground" color is like the color of the pen or paint that's used to draw or write on the paper. It's the color that's used to create the text or image itself. For example, if you write something on a white piece of paper using a black pen, the foreground color is black.
