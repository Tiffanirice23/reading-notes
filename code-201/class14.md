#### What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

> Trust, open communication, and respectful behavior.

#### Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

> I assume this question is asking about negative professional experiences in regards to psychological safety. My first job in Seattle, the owner decided he wanted to purchase several old commerical airplane engines on auction to have dissassembled in Brazil, and inventoried up in Seattle for future repair and sale (something I have a lot of experience in.) I was in charge of inventorying these parts, but the onwer was more concerned about getting inventory in quickly (75 units moved per day) rather than correctly... I advised him and the sales manager against this, because you can't sell something unless you're sure what it is and the requirement for reasale. Even though my management agreed that it wasn't a sustainable plan, the owner simply told me if I didn't meet this arbitrary quota I would be fired. Any effots to sway him on his decision resulted in threats and punishments.

#### What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

> Teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety tend to have a positive impact on both their company and team members. Psychological safety is the belief that one can speak up and share their ideas, concerns, and questions without fear of negative consequences or reprisal. Overall, teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety tend to be more productive, innovative, and engaged. This can have a positive impact on the company as a whole, leading to increased profitability, customer satisfaction, and employee retention.
