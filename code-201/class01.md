### What is Javascript

This topic is vital to our progress because understanding the terminology and jargon used in programming is essential to improving. Teachers will oftentimes use terms such as "variable" or "element", and it is important to fully be able to speak the language in order to integrate into our new career.

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.
> Oh, my broswer sent a request hurrily
To your HTTP server hostin'
Won't you give us your response presently?
So I can get to -a - postin'

2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
> HTML files are parsed by the browser first, leading any `<link>` element references to external CSS stylesheets and any `<script>`-element references to scripts. The browser generates an in-memory DOM tree from the parsed HTML, generates an in-memory CSSOM structure from the parsed CSS, and compiles and executes the parsed JavaScript.

3. How can you find images to add to a Website?
> Most images on the web are copyrighted. You can use Google's license fliter by going to [Google Images],(https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en&tab=ri&authuser=0&ogbl) clicking on the tools button, then on the resulting Usage rights option that appears below. You should choose the option Creative Commons licenses.

4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
> A String is a sequence of text enclosed in a set of single of double quote marks (Example: 'Joe' or "five"), while a number is simply a number and does not require any sort of syntax. 

5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?
> Variables are containers that store information that can be utilized later, and they are necessary in order to create programming that is dynamic and personalizable, such as a website alert or greeting message.

### What is an HTML attribute?
> An attribute contains additional information about an element, and has a space between it/ the element name, the attribute name (followed by an `=` sign), and an attribute value wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.

### Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.
> an HTML element is comprised first of an opening tag `<`, the content, then a closing tag `>`.

### What is the Difference between `<article>` and `<section>` element tags?
> An article tag encloses a single blog post, or a block of related content that can be understandable when on its own, while a section tag is ideal for grouping a set of article headlines or a part of the page that constitutes one piece of functionality.

### What Elements does a “typical” website include?
> A majority of webpages should include a header `<header>`, navigation bar `<nav>`, main content `<main>` (with various content represented by article, section, and div elements), a sidebar `<aside>` (often nested inside a main element) and a footer `<footer>`.

### How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?
> Metadata is used by search engines to forumlate the intention of the webpage and understand the content, and can be used yo help improve the visibility  and accessibility. 

### How is the `<meta>` HTML tag used when specifying metadata?
> The `<meta>` element is used to specify metadata about a document that provides additional information that is not displayed on the page but could be used by broswers and search engines. Common uses for the <meta> element are listed below:
> - Character encoding - specifies the endocing of the HTML. Example: `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
> - Viewport - directs the content to display on a mobile device. Example:`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />`
> - Description - Used to specify a description of the page. Example: 
`<meta Name="description"
  content="The MDN Web Docs site
  provides information about Open Web technologies
  including HTML, CSS, and APIs for both Web sites and
  progressive web apps." />`


*Miscellaneous*


### What is the first step to designing a Website?
> A necessary first step  to reach your goal is called *project ideation*. Firstly, ask yourself `What do I want to accomplish?`, then ask `"How will a website help me reach my goals?`, and lastly `"What needs to be done, and in what order to reach my goals?`.

### What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?
> Since it drives everything else, the most important question is `"What exactly do I want to accomplish?`. List all of the goals you want to reach!

*Semantics*

### Why should you use an `<h1>` element over a `<span>` element to display a top level heading?
> An `<h1>` element is a semantic one, and gives the text a "role" of a top level heading, whereas while a `<span>` element may look similiar too a header, it has no semantic value and would not be dynamic.

### What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?
> Some benefits of using semantic language in HTML are: 
1. search engines will consider your webpage as important and influence the page's search rankings.
2. Screen readers use it to help visually impaired users with their navigation.
3. Finding blocks of meaningful code is much easier than sifting through endless `<div>` elements.
4. Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated.
5. Semantic naming mirrors custom element and component naming.
