## Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

### Domain Modeling

#### Explain why we need domain modeling.
> Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model of a specific problem domain, which includes its concepts, relationships, constraints, and rules. The purpose of domain modeling is to provide a clear and shared understanding of the domain and its complexities. It is essential for effective problem-solving and solution design in any complex domain. By creating a shared understanding of the domain, stakeholders can work together more effectively to design solutions that meet the needs of the domain and its users.

### HTML Table Basics

#### Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
> While tables can be used for layout purposes, it is generally not recommended due to accessibility, maintenance, performance, and semantic issues. Using CSS for layout purposes is a more flexible and maintainable approach that can provide better accessibility and performance.

#### List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.
1. `<caption>`: is used to add a title or caption to an HTML table

2. `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`: These elements are used to group the content of a table into sections. The `<thead> `element contains the header rows of the table, while the `<tbody>` element contains the data rows. The `<tfoot>` element contains footer rows.

3. `<th>`: The `<th>` element is used to define header cells in an HTML table.

### Introducing Constructors

#### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
> A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's state by assigning values to its properties, allowing for the encapsulation, flexibility, inheritance, and readability of object initialization.

#### How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
> The this keyword behaves differently depending on how it is used. In an object literal, it refers to the object that contains the function, while in a constructor, it refers to the instance of the object that is being created.

### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

#### Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience. NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question

> Prototypes and inheritance in JavaScript can be compared to a senior employee and their junior colleagues. 
- a senior employee who has a wealth of knowledge and experience - a prototype in JavaScript is an object that contains a set of properties and methods that can be inherited by other objects.

- the junior colleagues learn from the practices of their senior coworker - inheritance is the mechanism by which one object is able to acquire the properties and methods of another object.
