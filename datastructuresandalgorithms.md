# Data Structures and Algorithms

### Discussion Questions

#### What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

> We should consider how frequently and its intended use when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem.

#### How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

> Work towards having a base case, a condition that stops the recursion and returns a result.
