#  Class 1: Growth Mindset & GitHub Pages

Markdown was created by John Gruber in 2004 as a lightweight language used to add formatting to plaintext text documents. 
You can add syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases will look different, unlike a WYSIWYG editor.

We use Markdown not only because it's supported by websites and most desktop/ web-based applications, it is also platform independent. 
Markdown can be created on any device on any operating system for the forseeable future.
