Growth Mindset can be summarized as <mark> the process of setting a reasonable mindset when pursuing a new hobby or occupation</mark>. Before moving forward with something fresh, it is important to be cognizant that my skills can and *WILL* be improved through dedication. My failures are not a representation of my future potential!

## 3 reminders to stay in a growth mindset

- Embrace criticisms by understanding that proficiency is gained through hard work, time, and dedicated practice. Making mistakes and being confused is inevitable when learning something new!
 
- The instant gratification of using the technology at my fingertips as a distraction from a challenge is tempting. While taking a break is vital for our bodies, it can be a slippery slope into long term avoidance. Healthier screen habits are essential to continually growing in my desired direction. 
 
 - Remembering that everyone possesses different skillsets. Seeing others florish while I'm slower to grasp the concept is not a reflection of my shortcomings! If anything, it showcases how a team can collaberate and delegate based on one another's strenghts& weaknesses
