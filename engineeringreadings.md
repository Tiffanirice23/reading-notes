# Engineering Readings

### 1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

> My communication skills and adaptability.

### 2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

 > I will begin first by trying to understand the problem, and figure out exactly what I'm trying to solve. Then I will start researching on Google to expand my knowledge base. Last, I will start a process of debugging and "trial and error" experimenting.
