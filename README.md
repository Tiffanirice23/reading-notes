# :left_speech_bubble: My name is Tiffani & I am very excited to start a new career!

Growth Mindset to me ==details== the process of setting reasonable expectations when researching and studying a new craft. Before moving forward with something fresh, it is important to be cognizant that my skills can and **WILL** be improved through hard work. My failures are not a representation of my future potential!

## 3 reminders to stay in a growth mindset

1. Embrace criticisms by understanding that expertise is not gained overnight. Making mistakes and being confused is inevitable when learning something new!
2. The instant gratification monkey is real, and I will avoid it by staying focused on the confusing task at hand!
3. I can do all things through spite which strengthens me. My enemies can do it; why not me? :raised_hands:
