<sub> *A  Code Fellows reading journal* </sub>

#	My name is Tiffani, and I'm ready to start learning code! 

I am a 27 year old professional from Pensacola, Florida currently living in the Seattle, Washington area. I had previously been managing commercial aviation warehouses for local OEM manufacturers and left once I noticed how many options there are for upward mobility within the tech industry. The beautiful Pacific Northwest offers a substantial selection of developer jobs, and I would be remiss to let this opportunity pass. 

Growth Mindset to me is <mark> the process of setting reasonable expectations when researching and studying a new craft. </mark> Before moving forward with something fresh, it is important to be cognizant that my skills can and *WILL* be improved through dedication. My failures are not a representation of my future potential!

## 3 reminders to stay in a growth mindset

- Embrace criticisms by understanding that proficiency is gained through hard work, time, and dedicated practice. Making mistakes and being confused is inevitable when learning something new!
 
- The instant gratification of using the technology at my fingertips as a distraction from a challenge is tempting. While taking a break is vital for our bodies, it can be a slippery slope into long term avoidance. Healthier screen habits are essential to continually growing in my desired direction. 
 
 - Remembering that everyone posses different skillsets. Seeing others florish while I'm slowly learning is not a reflection of my shortcomings! If anything, it showcases how a team should collaberate and delegate based on one another's strenghts& weaknesses
