# My name is Tiffani, and I am very excited to get started on a new career!

Growth Mindset to me details the process of setting reasonable expectations when researching and studying a new craft. Before moving forward with something fresh, it is important to be cognizant that my skills can and **WILL** be improved through hard work. My failures are not a representation of my future potential!

## 3 reminders to stay in a growth mindset

1. Embrace criticisms by understanding that expertise is not gained overnight. Making mistakes and being confused is inevitable when learning something new!
2. My enemies can do it; why not me? I can do all things through spite which strengthens me. :raised_hands:	
3. The economy is tough :sweat:, but I AM TOUGHER :pinched_fingers:
