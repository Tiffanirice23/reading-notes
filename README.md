#	My name is Tiffani & I am very excited to start a new career! 

I am a 27 year old from Pensacola, Florida currently living in Seattle, Washington. I had previously been managing commercial aviation warehouses for large, local OEM manufacturers and left once I noticed how many options there are for upward mobility within the tech industry. The PNW offers a substantially large selection of developer jobs to choose from, which I am looking foward to!

Growth Mindset to me <mark> details the process of setting reasonable expectations when researching and studying a new craft. </mark> Before moving forward with something fresh, it is important to be cognizant that my skills can and *WILL* be improved through hard work. My failures are not a representation of my future potential!

## 3 reminders to stay in a growth mindset

- [ ]  Embrace criticisms by understanding that expertise is not gained overnight. Making mistakes and being confused is inevitable when learning something new!
- [ ]  The instant gratification monkey is tricky, and I will avoid it by staying focused on the confusing task at hand without allowing distractions!
- [ ]  I can do all things through spite which strengthens me. My enemies can do it; why not me?
